# Devlog Entry - 11/21/24

## Introducing the team
Keaton: Tools Lead - Research alternative tools, identify good ones, and help every other team member set them up

Zoe: Assistant Tools and Design

Cal: Engine Lead - Research alternative engines, get buy-in from teammates on the choice, and teach peers how to use it

Jake: Design Lead - Responsible for setting the creative direction of the project, and establishing the look and feel of the game

Acer: Assistant Engine and Design

## Tools and materials

### Engines, libraries, frameworks, and platforms used and why
We chose TypeScript combined with HTML5 as the backbone of our project because of its alignment with our team's prior experience from previous demos. We didn't want to use Phaser because we thought it would limit the functionality and potential of the game, and we were unsure how it would work with TypeScript. There are also a lot of online resources and documentation for TypeScript to guide our learning and further assist with the development process.

### Programming Languages used and why
TypeScript serves as our primary programming language, complementing its powerful features with CSS and HTML for styling and structure. This will be ideal for implementing specific game mechanics for our project while adhering to software requirements.

### Other tools (IDE, image editor, 3D editor) used and why
Possible tools that we will use are Piskel and Pixilart for designing assets that support multiple resolutions, and animations, and can be saved on a spritesheet. Since we intend to source some assets online, TypeScript's integration with external resources ensures we can incorporate these elements seamlessly. To code we will mostly be using Visual Studio Code.

### Alternate platform choice
In the event that our current setup does not meet our needs, we have identified TypeScript combined with Three.js as a strong alternate platform choice. Three.js offers extensive functionality for 3D rendering and advanced visual effects. While it might increase the complexity of development, its compatibility with TypeScript ensures that the transition would not require a complete overhaul of our existing codebase or skill set.

## Outlook

### What is your team hoping to accomplish that other teams might not attempt?
We hope to be able to implement our own creative touch that makes our project stand out from the rest of the teams. We would like to stray away from the original theme and implement our own twist. We also want to add animations to our game to give it a more polished look.
### What do you anticipate being the hardest or riskiest part of the project?
The hardest or riskiest part of the project would probably be the scale. A common theme I find when creating games in general, but especially as a team, is when developers start to get excited about an idea they are passionate about, trying to complete a product that might not always be viable. We will have to focus on finishing the required and core components of our game before we get ahead of ourselves, making sure our end result is easily scalable and readable, even if that means less features.
### What are you hoping to learn by approaching the project with the tools and materials you selected above?
A lot of us are going to be learning new tools and or materials with the ones we selected above. Using a 3D engine, it will push the majority of our team to discover new developer techniques while creating our game. This paired with the high quality coding practices we've learned throughout class should allow us to keep a clean and consistent repository for seamless development.
