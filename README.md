## Tools and materials

### Engines, libraries, frameworks, and platforms used and why
We are using Unity 2d because a few on the team already have experience. Others wanted to learn something new and get comfortable with a game engine. We didn't want to use Phaser because we thought it would limit the functionality and potential of the game. There are also a lot of online resources and documentation for Unity to guide our learning and further assist with the development process.

### Programming Languages used and why
For our project using Unity, we are required to use C#, as it is the primary programming language supported by the Unity engine. This will be ideal for implementing specific game mechanics for our project while adhering to software requirements. Additionally, we plan to use JSON files for data storage and exchange.

### Other tools (IDE, image editor, 3D editor) used and why
Possible tools that we will use are Piskel and Pixilart for designing assets that support multiple resolutions, and animations, and can be saved on a spritesheet. Due to our use of Unity, the Unity Asset Store is always available to download free or paid assets. To code we will mostly be using Visual Studio Code.

### Alternate platform choice
Our alternate platform choice would be Godot, changing our primary language to GDScript, but we would only want to use this if we struggle creating our original concept in Unity.

## Outlook

### What is your team hoping to accomplish that other teams might not attempt?
We hope to be able to implement our own creative touch that makes our project stand out from the rest of the teams. We would like to stray away from the original theme and implement our own twist. We also want to add animations to our game to give it a more polished look.
### What do you anticipate being the hardest or riskiest part of the project?
The hardest or riskiest part of the project would probably be the scale. A common theme I find when creating games in general, but especially as a team, is when developers start to get excited about an idea they are passionate about, trying to complete a product that might not always be viable. We will have to focus on finishing the required and core components of our game before we get ahead of ourselves, making sure our end result is easily scalable and readable, even if that means less features.
### What are you hoping to learn by approaching the project with the tools and materials you selected above?
A lot of us are going to be learning new tools and or materials with the ones we selected above. Using a 3D engine, it will push the majority of our team to discover new developer techniques while creating our game. This paired with the high quality coding practices we've learned throughout class should allow us to keep a clean and consistent repository for seamless development.
