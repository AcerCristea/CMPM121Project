### What do you anticipate being the hardest or riskiest part of the project?
The hardest or riskiest part of the project would probably be the scale. A common theme I find when creating games in general, but especially as a team, is when developers start to get excited about an idea they are passionate about, trying to complete a product that might not always be viable. We will have to focus on finishing the required and core components of our game before we get ahead of ourselves, making sure our end result is easily scalable and readable, even if that means less features.
### What are you hoping to learn by approaching the project with the tools and materials you selected above?
A lot of us are going to be learning new tools and or materials with the ones we selected above. Using a 3D engine, it will push the majority of our team to discover new developer techniques while creating our game. This paired with the high quality coding practices we've learned throughout class should allow us to keep a clean and consistent repository for seamless development.
